# Recognize the President
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/F0b4q-piuhA
#### Description: Upload a photo on web to check if it contain the last 10 President of the United State. It takes advantage of Deepface library, which contain various facial detection and model to play with. I simply selected some quick one, and haven't fully tested all of them. To host it yourself, you need to change the LOCAL_PATH on app.py. I have already built in a database with the last 10 President of the United States. If you wanna add or change the photos for the database, YOU NEED TO DELETE THE .pkl file. For more details about Deepface https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/deepface
